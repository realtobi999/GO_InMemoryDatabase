# **Database In GO**

## **Summary**

- This is a in-memory database written entirely in **GO**.
- It works on a similiar concept as Redis, which is **KEY-VALUE** pairs stored on the server.
- Working **get,set,hset,hget and ping** commands

## **Notes**

This is a smaller project on which i learned coding a bit challenging logic. I've learned how to setup a basic server, marshalling logic and how to create a reliable system for storing data.
